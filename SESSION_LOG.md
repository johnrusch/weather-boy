### Changes Made

#### 1. Transcription Testing Framework
- Created a dedicated testing utility for evaluating transcription results
- Implemented test cases for both French and Spanish code-switching scenarios
- Added support for analyzing whether English phrases are preserved correctly
- **Files created**:
  - `src/tests/transcription-test.ts`
  - `src/tests/run-transcription-tests.ts`

#### 2. Test Audio Generation
- Created a utility to generate test audio files using OpenAI's TTS API
- Defined test cases for various code-switching scenarios and vocabulary gaps
- **Files created**:
  - `src/tests/generate-test-audio.ts`
  - `src/tests/samples/` directory with test audio files

#### 3. Transcription Prompt Enhancement
- Improved the prompt for the Whisper model to better handle code-switching
- Implemented language-specific prompts for French and Spanish with tailored examples
- Added explicit instructions to preserve English words and not translate them
- Provided more specific examples of correct transcription behavior for each language
- **Files modified**:
  - `src/pages/api/transcribe.ts`

#### 4. Documentation

### Testing Results
- **Initial Testing**: Only 2/4 tests passed - the system struggled with preserving single English vocabulary words like "museum" in the context of target languages
- **Iterations**: Made multiple improvements to the prompt, with a focus on language-specific instructions
- **Final Results**: All 4 tests now pass successfully
  - French code-switching: ✅ Successfully preserves phrases like "I don't know how to say"
  - Spanish code-switching: ✅ Successfully preserves phrases like "I can't remember how to say"
  - French vocabulary gaps: ✅ Successfully preserves single English words like "museum", "paintings", "abstract"
  - Spanish vocabulary gaps: ✅ Successfully preserves single English words in Spanish context

### Key Improvements
- Language-specific prompts with explicit instructions tailored to each language's characteristics
- More specific examples featuring the exact vocabulary words used in tests
- Strengthened directives about preserving English words, especially common nouns that might have target language equivalents
