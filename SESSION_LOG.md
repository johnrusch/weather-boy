## [2025-02-27] Troubleshooting: Language Selector Functionality

### Summary
Fixed issues with the language selector not updating the application state when changing languages. Implemented a more direct integration between the site header and the application using localStorage and custom events.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Simplified Architecture
- Removed the React context approach in favor of a more direct implementation
- Used localStorage as the source of truth for language preference
- Added custom event dispatching for cross-component communication

- Enhanced the script with better error handling and logging
- **Files modified**: `src/layouts/SiteLayout.astro`

#### 3. Application State Management
- Updated the LanguageLearningApp component to listen for language change events
- Added direct localStorage access to ensure consistency with the header selection
- Implemented additional debug UI to help troubleshoot language switching
- **Files modified**: `src/components/LanguageLearningApp.tsx`

### Technical Details
- The language selection is now stored in localStorage under the key `preferredLanguage`
- Components communicate via a custom `languageChanged` event
- The application checks localStorage on initialization and listens for change events
- Debug UI in the application shows the current language and allows direct switching

### Testing Notes
- Verified that selecting Spanish in the header correctly updates the application
